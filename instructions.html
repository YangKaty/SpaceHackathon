        <h2>Welcome to Planet Escaper</h2>
            <ul> 
                <li>You are lost, floating in space after an attack for front row seats in the new star wars movie.</li>
                <li>thankfully, you still have your trusty gps to locate all the parts of your space ship</li>
                <li>So, in order to get back home, you have to collect all the ship pieces in order to properly return to earth!</li>
                <li>But be careful </li>
                <li>You can not risk another hit or else your ship will crash!</li>
                <li>note: REMEMBER TO GO BACK TO EARTH AFTER YOU ARE DONE!!</li>
